# Breaking down Energy2028's Four Commitments

This project aims to keep students informed on the College's progress on meeting their four major commitments that make up the Energy2028 plan.

The series will be released in four parts: Divestment, Energy Conservation, Renewable Energy and Education.

All of the code for this project will be open-source and available on our GitHub page. 

This is an exciting step in the development of data-driven, visual and enterprise projects from The Middlebury Campus.
