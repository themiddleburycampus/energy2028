      <p>After a decade-long crusade of student activism, Middlebury has begun its long march toward divestment. In a unanimous decision last January, the Board of Trustees approved Energy 2028—an ambitious and sweeping plan in response to the mounting climate crisis. With the vote, the Board set a timeline for meeting a series of goals.</p>
      <p>The first of these was August 1, when the college pledged to halt all new direct investments in fossil fuel. The college currently has 5.1% [PAJ1] [PAJ2] directly invested in fossil fuels—a dollar amount of $53.5 million. </p>

      <h3 class="breaker">Why now?</h3>
 
      <p>In the end, the college decided to bundle its divestment plan with three other environmental initiatives: energy conservation, renewable energy, and environmental education.  Packaging the divestment pledge with these other initiatives was strategic, as college officials sought to make the plan palatable to the board of trustees.</p>

      <p>At the same time, students changed their own tactics. After years of futile protests, they took a more business-like approach with their campaign, called Divest Middlebury, donning suits and high heels and making a formal presentation to the Board of Trustees. And it worked.</p>
 
      <p>“The way that Energy 2028 is packaged makes it really hard for board members to say no,” said Cora Kircher ‘20, a leading member of Divest Middlebury. “If you say ‘no’ to this one pillar, then you’re saying ‘no’ to all these other dimensions.”</p>
 
<p>Now that the confetti has settled, the college has done little to tout its progress so far on the divestment front. Indeed, the first benchmark came and went on August 1 with little fanfare. But in interviews with Middlebury’s financial officers and student leaders, a picture has emerged of a college working to make good on its promises, while delaying important aspects of plan...despite xxx.</p>  
 
<h3 class="breaker">Generational inheritance</h3>
 
<p>Despite the uphill battle for divestment waged by students, one that was initially quashed by the trustees in 2013, the college has a long history of environmental stewardship. </p>

<p>“In the seventies, this college made a point to be the first college in America to have an Environmental Studies program and the first to say we were going to achieve carbon neutrality,” said vice president for finance David Provost. “We have been at the leading edge of addressing climate change. If it were anyone’s position to lead in this space, it is Middlebury College.”
 
<p>But for years, according to student campaigners, the Board was able to use the college’s generational turnover every four years as a means of postponing fossil fuel divestment. MIDDLEBURY WAS THE 50TH COLLEGE , or not the first?, TO ANNOUNCE A DIVESTMENT PLAN, ACCORDING TO THE BLAH BLAH. But in 2017, a few students began to use this turnover to their advantage.

<h3 class="breaker">Looking forward</h3>
 
<p>Despite the assumption that an environmental plan called “Energy 2028” would be fully realized in 2028, the college’s press release back in January stipulated that full fossil fuel divestment will in fact be achieved 15 years later—in 2034.</p>
 
<p>Still, many aspects of Middlebury’s ultimate divestment plan were praised by Divest Middlebury’s team. “What I was excited about was how they defined fossil fuels,” Kircher said. “They included pipelines and infrastructure. They have the largest definition of what fossil fuels are from any divestment movement.”</p>
 
<p>But with a longer roll-out than the name “Energy 2028” suggests? “The 15-year thing is not great,” she conceded.</p>
 
<p>In their defense, college officials say that divestment is not a quick process, given the 
Wall Street mantra to buy low and sell high. “The board was most concerned that if we had done what the students had asked of ‘Sell all your fossil fuel assets today,’ and fossil fuel investments were depressed at that time, we would be walking away from money,” Provost said. “And that would fly in the face of the Board’s fiduciary responsibly.”
