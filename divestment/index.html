      <p><span style="float: left; width: 0.8em; font-size: 500%; courier; line-height: 85%;">A</span>fter a decade-long crusade of student activism, Middlebury has begun its long march toward divestment. In a unanimous decision last January, the Board of Trustees approved Energy 2028—an ambitious and sweeping plan in response to the mounting climate crisis. With the vote, the Board set a timeline for meeting a series of goals and environmentally-minded initiatives. </p>

      <p>In terms of divestment, the first of these dates was August 1, when the college pledged to halt all new direct investments in the fossil fuel industry. The college currently has 5.1% directly invested in fossil fuels—a dollar amount of $53.5 million. Looking ahead, the college plans on divesting in stages—25 percent reduction by 2021, 50 percent by 2026, and a total 100 percent by 2033. 
</p>
 
      <p>According to 350.org, the Middlebury-founded national environmental organization, about <a href="https://gofossilfree.org/divestment/commitments/" target="_blank">40 U.S. educational institutions</a> have divested thus far. And Middlebury’s commitment is more inclusive than many others (Columbia and Stanford have pledged only to divest from coal). The college will divest not only from companies whose core business is oil and gas production, but also those that are involved on the infrastructure end, whether through equipment, pipelines or services. </p>

      <p>The Middlebury divestment campaign began in 2011, but gathered steam in the past few years. Waves of students have adopted the campaign as earlier activists have graduated. The final push was led by a group of sophomores in 2017 who devoted themselves to drafting presentations and organizing rallies under the umbrella of the Sunday Night Environmental Group (SNEG). The fact that they weren’t graduating anytime soon certainly helped, students and college officials say. </p>
 
      <p>According to one of the leaders on the forefront of the Divest Middlebury campaign, Zoe Grodsky ’20.5, the intense time commitment leading up to the Board’s vote prompted students to dial back their activism or put their focus elsewhere. “We’re all pretty burnt out after what happened in January,” she said. “We haven’t necessarily been working on accountability.”</p>
 
<p>Indeed, there does not appear to be any structure in place for the administration to communicate divestment milestones to the Middlebury community. And now that the confetti has settled on the Board’s landmark vote, the college has done little to tout its progress. (The first benchmark came and went on August 1 with little fanfare.) But in interviews with Middlebury’s financial officers and student leaders, a picture has emerged of a college working to make good on its promises, despite a lack of transparency. </p>  

<p>Part of the problem seems to be the campaign’s generous timeframe: the Energy 2028 goal posts - stretched across 15 years, despite its name - will mean that the college won’t need to make announcements, even annually. </p>

<p>Still, in President Laurie Patton’s original address to the college last January, she claimed that the college hoped to beat the 15-year mark. “We understand that time is of the essence and that this is a floor and not a ceiling,” she said. “We will make every effort to get there quicker.”</p>

<h3 class="breaker">Why now?</h3>

<p>As the issue headed to the Board of Trustees earlier this year, the college decided to bundle its divestment plan with three other environmental goals: energy conservation, renewable energy, and environmental education.  Folding those initiatives into the divestment pledge was largely strategic, as college officials sought to make the plan more palatable to the trustees.</p>

<p>At the same time, students changed their own tactics. After years of futile protests (and even a divestment-themed day party--dubbed “darty”--in 2013), a new generation of students took a more business-like approach to their campaign. In addition to arming themselves with statistics, they donned suits and high heels for a formal presentation to the Board of Trustees. It worked.</p>

        <h2 class="item_desc" id="2028" style="display:none">Following a unanimous vote to divest from fossil fuels by the Board of Trustees, the College announces the Energy2028 plan, which named divestment as one of its four key pillars.</h2>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Instead of making an emotional appeal about climate change and the fate of the planet, student activists tailored their argument, embracing the broader environmental plan put forward by the college and identifying key allies within the administration. “We tried to go with the moral argument for so long,” Grodsky said. “And it should work. As an institution that cares about the human population, Middlebury should divest from fossil fuels. But that’s not enough and it just won’t be for any school.” </p>

<p>“The way that Energy 2028 is packaged makes it really hard for board members to say no,” said Cora Kircher ’20, a leading member of Divest Middlebury. “If you say ‘no’ to this one pillar, then you’re saying ‘no’ to all these other dimensions.”</p>
<p>David Provost, the college’s treasurer, also emerged as an invaluable resource. “I think without David this wouldn’t have happened,” Grodsky said. “Identifying him as an ally was a huge game changer.”</p>
<p>Elisa Gan ’20, the student liaison to the SGA on endowment affairs and the only student member of the Board’s Investment Committee, estimated that Provost devoted some 300 hours to the divestment issue since joining the college in 2017, via strategy sessions and negotiations. Provost coached students through divestment presentations and walked them through financial jargon, teaching them the language they needed to speak on the Investment Committee’s terms.</p>
<p>Despite the uphill battle waged by students (the trustees had voted against divestment in 2013), the college has a long history of environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>“In the seventies, this college made a point to be the first college in America to have an Environmental Studies program and the first to say we were going to achieve carbon neutrality,” said Provost. “We have been at the leading edge of addressing climate change. If it were anyone’s position to lead in this space, it is Middlebury College.”</p>


<h3 class="breaker">Looking forward</h3>
<p>While some students were taken aback that divestment under “Energy 2028” would be implemented in 15 years, not 10, others praised aspects of Middlebury’s ultimate divestment plan. “What I was excited about was how they defined fossil fuels,” Kircher said. “They included pipelines and infrastructure. They have the largest definition of what fossil fuels are from any divestment movement.”</p>
<p>But with a longer roll-out? “The 15-year thing is not great,” she conceded.</p>
<p>In their defense, college officials say that divestment is not a quick process, given the Wall Street mantra to buy low and sell high. “The board was most concerned that if we had done what the students had asked of ‘Sell all your fossil fuel assets today,’ and fossil fuel investments were depressed at that time, we would be walking away from money,” Provost said. “And that would fly in the face of the Board’s fiduciary responsibility.”
</p>
<p>The 15-year plan was settled on during negotiations with the college’s investment manager, Investure. The Virginia-based equity firm oversees the majority of the college’s endowment through a “hands-off” structure in which managers have free reign over what to invest in. But in response to Middlebury’s demands, Investure agreed to facilitate complete fossil fuel divestment through the creation of “fossil-free portfolios.”</p>
<p>In order to transition the college’s current endowment portfolio from fossil fuels, 15 years was needed in order to comply with Investure’s model.</p>
<p>“Fifteen years is simply the amount of time that every transaction we’re currently invested in goes on its natural progression of maturing and then new money coming back in,” Provost said. “The last one of those, the furthest one out, was 15 years. The maturity is going to be done in the 7 to 8-year time frame. We estimate that the 5.3% will be significantly below 1% by 2028. Fifteen years is just the tail.”</p>

<h3 class="breaker">Where will the money go instead?</h3>

<p>Middlebury is not alone among colleges in outsourcing its financial investment decisions. Continued resistance to divestment came from the firm’s former CEO, Alice Handy. Her departure in 2018 led to new conversations on how the firm could accommodate Middlebury’s environmental stewardship. </p>

<p>Although Middlebury is the firm’s largest client, additional pressure has also come from other institutions. Smith College is one of these institutions, which followed Middlebury’s lead by committing to divest from fossil fuels just last week (October 21).</p>

<p>But proprietary concerns make the endowment’s investment portfolio difficult to publicly disclose. As of December 31, the college had a total of $1.04 billion invested through Investure. Of that total, $53.5 million was “exposed” to the fossil fuel industry (meaning, directly or indirectly in the fossil fuel industry) while only a fraction of that is directly invested in coal, with $950,000 or 0.1% of the entire endowment. Yet in the last three years, the college’s fossil fuel investments have grown by $10 million.</p>

<p>According to Provost, there is another $100 million of the endowment that is not accounted for in Investure’s holdings. These are privately invested through donations with specific stipulations.</p>

<p>In contrast to its financial foothold in fossil fuels, the Board of Trustees has repeatedly voted to ramp up sustainable investments in the last decade. The most drastic change came in 2014 when the Investment Committee upped its commitment to sustainable investment to $50 million (from the mere $4 million endorsed four years prior). This move followed the only other time the board explicitly voted on divestment in 2013, when it said no.</p>
<p>The $50 million commitment alone pushed the college’s investments in ESGs to eclipse those in fossil fuels. Since then, the Board has voted to move an additional $19.3 million into sustainable assets. According to President Patton, the endowment’s stake in sustainable investments will continue to grow in tandem with its decrease in fossil fuels. </p>
<p>“You will see a continued increase in ESGs and renewable assets as they come on the market,” Provost said. “We’re finding more now and I expect those will continue to grow.”</p>

<h3 class="breaker">The slippery slope</h3>
<p>One of the greatest concerns of divestment skeptics was the “slippery slope question”—that divesting from fossil fuels would inevitably lead to students returning to the Board year after year demanding additional divestments from other controversial sectors.</p>

<p> 
“The board wanted to make sure that they weren’t being asked by students every year to divest from another sector,” Provost said. “Guns. Tobacco. Prisons.”
</p>

<p>During the faculty referendum last year—where a notable 98% voted for divestment—one professor expressed concern. “What’s next? Arms? Prisons? Pornography?” political science professor Keegan Callanan infamously said according to faculty present at the event.</p>
<p>The Board’s concerns may not have been simply conjectural either. Those involved in the Divest Middlebury movement, along with SGA members, are now raising concerns about privatized prison investment, amid the national campaign against mass incarceration. An SGA email sent out to students last week solicited opinions on the college’s financial stake in such prisons.</p>
<p>Elisa Gan, the student liaison and sole student to attend the trustees’ Investment Committee meetings, is responsible for serving as a bridge between students and Board members. This year, in her newly elected position, she plans to spark conversations between the Board and the student body on issues such as private prisons and weapon manufacturers.</p>
<p>Some students think the slippery slope is exactly what should be happening. According to them as ethically dubious come to light, the college should be removing its financial links. “In a dream world, I think that we should be divesting from prisons, from arms,” Kircher said. “Yeah, please-- bring on the slippery slope.”</p>
