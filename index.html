      <h1><b>Energy2028, explained</b></h1>
      <h2><b>A four-part series</b></h2>

      <h2>On January 29, 2019, Middlebury College announced an ambitious plan to combat the threat of climate change. The plan included three major commitments: transition the College to 100% renewable energy sources, significantly reduce energy consumption and divest the over $1 billion endowment from fossil fuel investments.</h2>
      <h2>However, questions remain about how the College will achieve these goals, and what it will mean for the students, staff, and faculty of the College. Through this project, the Campus is committing to 1) critically reporting on the progress of the College in meeting these goals, and 2) offering students context, background and a deeper understanding of how this process will work.</h2>
